How it works:
    Be sure your directory structure looks like the following example,
    otherwise it won't work as expected:

                             maindir
                                |
                                |
      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
     |                       |                |                |
     |                       |                |                |
install-champ.ps1          folder1          folder2          folder3

                             |                |                |
